# EXERCISE2
# Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers.
# Sample numbers: ```numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)```
# Expected Output :
# ```
# Number of even numbers : 5
# Number of odd numbers : 4

# EXERCISE3
# Write a Python program that accepts a sequence of lines (blank line to terminate) as input and prints the lines as output after User enters a blank line to end.
# Do not use an array to hold the lines of text
# Hints:
# You can use ```"\n"``` if you want to add a line break between sentences
